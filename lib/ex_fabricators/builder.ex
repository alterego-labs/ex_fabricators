defmodule ExFabricators.Builder do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines a fabricators builders.

  Builder provides a set of macroses for defining fabricators.
  Also provides functional for running fabricators.
  The result of building is a one or a bunch of structs.

  This builder can be useful in ExUnit tests when you need to prepare some structs as a
  income for a testable module function callings.

  For first you need to define a context in which you will define fabricators. For example, it
  may be `test/fabricators.ex`:

    defmodule Fabricators do
      use ExFabricators.Builder

      fabricator :team, YourApp.Structs.Team, %{}
    end

  Then in tests or in setup callbacks you can run fabricators like this:
    
    Fabricators.build :team

  As a result you give initialized `YourApp.Structs.Team` struct with default properties.

  If you try to build undefined fabricator `RuntimeError` will be thrown.

  Generates a fabricator builder match based on its name.
  
  ## Examples:

    fabricator :team, YourApp.Structs.Team, %{}

  The last parameter is a Map with options. So, for example, if your Team struct has `id`
  property and you want to set it while building do it like the following:
    
    fabricator :team, YourApp.Structs.Team, %{id: 2}

  The you can provide some dependencies for the building structs:
    
    fabricator :event, YourApp.Structs.Event, %{home_team: Fabricators.build(:team)}
